  Run JavaScript anywhere. <b>Safely</b>.

<hr />

Edge.js is a secure **JavaScript** runtime, designed for Edge computing and AI workloads.

Edge.js **uses WebAssembly** for sandboxing when in `--safe` mode, so even the most insecure programs can run on it safely. Edge also is:

* ✅ Fully **compatible with Node.js**.
* 🔒 **Sandboxed** by design.
* 🧩 Pluggable with any **JS engine**: V8, JavaScriptCore or QuickJS.
* 💪 Compatible with **any package manager**: NPM/PNPM/Yarn/Bun.

## Install Edge.js

```bash
curl -fsSL https://edgejs.org/install | bash
```

## Use it!

You can use it as you would do it with Node.js:

```js
const http = require("node:http");

http
  .createServer((_req, res) => {
    res.end("hello from edge\n");
  })
  .listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("listening on http://localhost:3000");
  });
```

```bash
$ edge server.js
```

If you want to use it in your current workflow, just wrap your commands with `edge`:

```bash
$ edge node myfile.js
$ edge npm install
$ edge pnpm run dev
```

## Development

Build the CLI locally:

```bash
make build
./build-edge/edge server.js
```

```bash
./build-edge/edge --run dev
```

Or run the tests:
```bash
make test
NODE_TEST_RUNNER="$(pwd)/build-edge/edge" \
./test/nodejs_test_harness --category=node:assert
```


## Contribute 🤗

We have created a [public ROADMAP](https://github.com/wasmerio/edgejs/issues/8), so you can contribute into the project easily!

- `0.x` Production readiness: platform coverage across Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android; reliability in constrained environments; security audits; and successful real production use.
- `1.x` Need for speed: faster startup, faster core paths, and performance that competes with or beats Node.js, Bun, and Deno on most workloads.
- `2.x` Enhancements: first-class TypeScript support and a smoother developer experience.

For architecture detail, see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md).
